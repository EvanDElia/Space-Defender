				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>
				Click anywhere to pause. In this game you must press and hold R, D, and V at the same time in order to move left and press and hold U, K, and B at the same time in order to move right. Press and hold the spacebar in order to shoot bombs. The game ends when the song ends you must survive until the end without a “game over”. You cannot skip ahead in the song. You advance one level each time you defeat 20 enemies. Deafeating an enemy gets you 15 points. After each level the speed of the enemies increases slightly. The game is about timing your movements and keeping track of all 6 lanes that enemies may try to attack you from. If 5 enemies slip past your defenses its game over. In order to restart the game at anytime simply refresh the page.
