# Space-Defender
In this game you play as a lone rebel warrior attempting to defend Earth from the viscous alien foes descsending on the planet. I made this game in under a week. The goal of the game is to test patience, timing, and ingenuity.
# Controls
This game is unique in that you must press and hold buttons in order to use them. For instance, to move right press and hold U, K, and B for just the right amount of time. See a full description of the instructions by playing the game!
# Cheats
There are currently two known ways to cheat and win the game. Are you clever enough to find them. The cheats exploit the way the computer processes key strokes and how often the javascript engine requests an animation frame. If you find any cheats please email me at deliaevan1@gmail.com. If you complete the game send me a screenshot and I will post the screenshot to the webpage under a leaderboard section.
